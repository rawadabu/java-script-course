# Data structures, Modern operators and Strings
## Destructuring Arrays
`const [x, y, z] = arr;`

## Destructuring Objects
`const {x: new name, y, z} = arr;`

## The Spread Operator (...)
Its like taking all the elements out of the array, and writing them manually on the new array.
`const newArr = [1,2,...arr];`
