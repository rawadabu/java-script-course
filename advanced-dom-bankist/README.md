# Advanced DOM and Events

## How DOM really works?

So first, remember that the DOM is basically the interface between all JavaScript code and the browser, or more specifically HTML documents
that are rendered in and by the browser.

- Allows us to make JavaScript interact with the browser.(API)
- the DOM is a very complex Application Programming Interface that contains lots of methods and properties to interact with the DOM three.
  Such as `.quertySelector() / .addEventListener() / .createElement() / .innerHTML / .textContent / .children/  etc...`
- DOM tree is generated from an HTML documant, which we can then interact with.
